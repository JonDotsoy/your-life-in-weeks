### Create Life Calendar Website

Create a web page that displays the "Life Calendar" in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner, allowing users to print or download the calendar for their personal use. The page should include a brief introduction to the concept of the life calendar, along with a clear layout and design that makes it easy to navigate and find specific events and dates.

The Life Calendar website can be accessed at https://jondotsoy.github.io/your-life-in-weeks/life-calendar.

### Create Life Calendar Editor

Implement an interactive web-based editor that allows users to connect their GitHub or Google Drive accounts, retrieve their life calendar events, and edit them in a text-based format using Markdown syntax. The editor should provide a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting events, as well as synchronizing changes with the connected cloud storage service.
